# Mirage

Mirage is a mod that gives any enemy the ability to mimic a player's voice (fully synced to all players).  
**This mod is required by the host and on all clients.** Clients that do not have the mod will run into desynchronization issues.

## Features

- Mimic the voice of a player for any enemy (such as bracken, dress girl, modded enemies, etc)
   - Use the same player's voice every time it attempts to mimic their voice
   - Voice is synced to all players, where everyone hears the same voice
   - Only masked enemies mimic voices by default, other enemies can be enabled via config
- Spawn a masked enemy on player death (like a player turning into a zombie)
   - Chance to spawn on death can be configured
   - Set this to 0 to disable the feature
   - Can be configured to only spawn if the dying player is alone
- Masked enemies use the mimicking player's suit
- Remove the mask off of masked enemy
- Remove the arms out animation off of masked enemy
- Remove the post-round credits penalty (configurable)
- Configuration is synced to all players (only the host's config is used)

## Why do players who disconnect no longer get their voice mimicked?

Voices of each player are stored on the respective player's individual storage. Since
the player is no longer connected, their client cannot send audio clips to other clients.

##  I have a suggestion for the mod, and/or have found a bug

Whether you have a suggestion or have a bug to report, please submit it as an issue [here](https://github.com/qwbarch/lc-mirage/issues/new).

## Frequently asked questions

#### Do I need Skinwalkers for this mod to work?

No, Mirage is a standalone mod. Installing both Mirage and Skinwalkers will result in some voice clips to be unsynced.

#### Can I use MaskedEnemyOverhaul with this mod?

MaskedEnemyOverhaul will cause the masked enemy's suit and mimicking voice to not match.  
Use [MaskedEnemyOverhaulFork](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Coppertiel/MaskedEnemyOverhaulFork/) instead, with
the ``Dont Touch MaskedPlayerEnemy.mimickingPlayer`` configuration set to ``true``.

#### Do I need DissonanceLagFix installed?

No. Mirage now applies the lag fix patch as of ``v1.0.16``.

#### Does this mod support cosmetics?

Yes, any mod that applies to masked enemies should be compatible with Mirage.  
If the cosmetic mod you use does not support masked enemies, you will need to request the mod author to support it.

#### Does this mod use voice recognition and/or AI?

Not currently, but it is currently a work in progress and will eventually come in ``v2.0.0``.

#### Can I hear my own voice from voice mimics?

By default, yes. You can configure to not be able to hear them while alive, and resume being able to hear them while spectating.

- [EnemyFix](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SZAKI/EnemyFix/) - Failsafe for when mod conflicts occur, enemies will still gracefully despawn.

- [LethalQuantities](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BananaPuncher714/LethalQuantities/) - Spawn control. Use this to modify the masked enemy's spawn rate.

## Can I reupload the mod to Thunderstore?

No, reuploading the mod to Thunderstore is not permitted. If you are creating a modpack, please use the official mod.  
If you're making small changes for your friends, you will need to share the compiled ``.dll`` directly with them, and then import it locally.
